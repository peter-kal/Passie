summary: A simple, yet powerful password generator.
description: |
  Passie is a password generator build with _Flutter_, and _Yaru widgets_.
  You are able to choose if you want numbers, symbols, Capital or Lower case letters; as well as the number of characters.
  Passie is **Open-Source**(licensed under MPL-2.0), and **strictly confined**, meaning it hasn't access to things it doesn't need, 
  like: _internet_, or _system files_.
  Feel safe generating your passwords.
